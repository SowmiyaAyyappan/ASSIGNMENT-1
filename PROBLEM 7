By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th
prime is 13.
What is the 10,001st prime number?

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    long count, currentNumber, primeCount;
    primeCount = 1;
    for (currentNumber = 3; primeCount != 10001; currentNumber = currentNumber + 2) 
    {
        for (count = 3; count < currentNumber; count = count + 2) 
        {
            if (currentNumber % count == 0)
                break;
        }
        if (count == currentNumber)
            primeCount++;
    }
    printf("10001st Prime number: %li", count);
    return 0;
}
