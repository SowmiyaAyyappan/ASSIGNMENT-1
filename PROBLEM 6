The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1
2+2
2+3
2 ... + 10
2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10)
2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum.


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int a = 0, sum = 0, i;

  for (i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    a += i*i;
    sum += i;
  }
  printf("%d\n", a*a - sum);
  return 0;
}
